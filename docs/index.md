Orchestra is a composable AI agent infrastructure built on LangGraph and powered by the [MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) & [A2A](https://github.com/google/A2A) protocols by [Mifune](https://mifune.dev).

## What is Orchestra?

Orchestra provides a flexible, API-first platform for building and deploying AI agents. Unlike monolithic AI solutions, Orchestra gives you the freedom to compose your own AI workflows using best-in-class protocols and models.

**The goal of Orchestra is to enrich the lives of the curious** - those who seek to buy back their time and compound their personal growth. Those who build and don't wait for IT to be built for them.

## Who Is This For?

-   **Developers** building AI-powered applications who need flexible, protocol-based integrations
-   **Teams** wanting to leverage multiple AI models and tools in a unified platform
-   **Organizations** seeking to maintain control over their AI infrastructure while using open standards
-   **Innovators** who want to experiment with cutting-edge agent protocols (MCP, A2A)

## Core Features

### 🤖 Flexible AI Assistants

Create pre-configured AI agents with specific instructions, tools, and behaviors. Deploy them via API or use them directly in the web interface.

-   **Custom Instructions**: Define personality and expertise for each assistant
-   **Tool Integration**: Connect assistants to MCP servers, A2A agents, and built-in tools
-   **Persistent Configuration**: Save and reuse assistant configurations across projects

[Learn more about Assistants →](assistants/index.md)

### 💬 Conversation Threads

Manage stateful conversations with full message history and context persistence.

-   **Message History**: Full conversation tracking with tool execution logs
-   **File Attachments**: Upload and reference documents within threads
-   **Model Flexibility**: Switch between models mid-conversation
-   **Multi-Modal Support**: Text, images, and audio inputs

[Learn more about Threads →](threads/index.md)

### 🔌 Protocol Integration

Orchestra provides native support for open agent protocols, making it easy to connect external tools and services.

-   **[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](./tools/mcp.md)**: Connect to MCP-compatible tools and data sources
-   **[Agent-2-Agent (A2A)](./tools/a2a.md)**: Enable communication between autonomous agents
-   **[Search Integration](./tools/search.md)**: Built-in web search via Searx

[Explore Tools & Integrations →](tools/tools.md)

### 📁 Storage & RAG

S3-compatible object storage with document retrieval capabilities for building knowledge-enhanced agents.

-   **File Management**: Upload and manage documents via S3-compatible API (MinIO)
-   **RAG Projects**: Create searchable document indexes for retrieval-augmented generation
-   **Flexible Querying**: Filter and search across your document collections
